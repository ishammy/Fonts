# Alisha Font
- I made this font since I like notetaking and I don't like when my handwriting is inconsistent, sometimes writing so much can take time and it hurts after a while. I thought maybe it would be cool if I could just make my own font so I could just focus on typing.
- Its my first ever font so I'll still be making adjustments every now and then.
